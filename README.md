# Coursera-Statistical-Inference-Project

* Coursera Statistical Inference project has two parts,
* In part 1: Investigate the averages of 40 exponentials with a lambda = 0.2 for 1000 simulations approaches Normal Distribution, which validates Central Limit theorem.
* Here lambda is a parameter for the exponential distribution.
* Standard deviation = Mean = 1/lambda.
* Part 2: Data Analysis on a dataset from R "ToothGrowth".
* Here there are two columns which states the tooth growth for two supplements.
* VC - Ascorbic Acid, OJ - Orange Juice, for different dosages of range -.5mg/day - 2mg/day.
* Conduct Hypothesis tests for different dosages and check the statistical significance, also constructing the confidence intervals.
